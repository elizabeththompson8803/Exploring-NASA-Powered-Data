# Exploring NASA Powered Data

## Description
This project applies supervised machine learning to daily climate data from the NASA POWER Project to predict average temperature in Phoenix, Arizona. The goal is to compare models and illustrate the bias–variance tradeoff using real-world environmental data.

## Methods
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Regression  
- Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)  
- Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)

## Data
- Source: NASA POWER Project (AWS Open Data)  
- Location: Phoenix, AZ  
- Time range: 2010–2020  
- Variables: temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, precipitation  

## Tools
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- requests  

## Usage
1. Run the data download script to retrieve NASA POWER data.
2. Execute the notebook or script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
